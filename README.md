This course introduces methods in data science, focusing on exploring and visualizing data, framing
hypotheses, selecting appropriate methodologies, implementing analysis, applying diagnostics and interpreting results in the context of the scientific questions. Statistical programming and computational
reasoning are emphasized using case studies. Topics include data visualization, data manipulation, data analysis and presentation. Reproducible research methods are emphasized.

Elementary knowledge of statistical methods at the level of a first course in statistics is assumed. Students will learn to program and implement all techniques using the free statistical software package, R
(http://cran.r-project.org/) and the interactive notebook environment, Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/).
